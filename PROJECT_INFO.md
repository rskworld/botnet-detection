## Project Details

- **ID**: 8
- **Title**: Botnet Detection with Machine Learning
- **Category**: ML Projects
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate
- **Description**: ML-based system to detect botnet activities and compromised devices in network traffic.

## Full Description

This project develops a botnet detection system that identifies botnet-infected devices by analyzing network communication patterns, DNS queries, and traffic characteristics. It uses machine learning to distinguish between normal and botnet traffic.

## Technologies

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## Features

1. Network traffic analysis
2. Botnet pattern recognition
3. DNS query analysis
4. Classification model training
5. Detection accuracy metrics
